# Black-Scholes-Calculator
Python version - This program returns the theoretical price of a call and put along with their greeks once stock, strike price, and time to expiration are entered. See picture below. I prefer to use this calculator over anything I have seen online because the interest rate and volatility of the entered stock ticker are web-scraped instantly without need for input by the user. 

Java/C# version - price, strike, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration are entered by the user and data is calculated using functional programming.
